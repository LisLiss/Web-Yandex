          HPMOR was launched on the web&shy;site Plan&shy;eta.ru. The ₽1.086 mil&shy;lion goal

          project: the book was pub&shy;lished by fans many times, but the book's cir&shy;cu&shy;la&shy;tion

          the idea

          him. Yudkowsky wrote an
          in&shy;tro&shy;duc&shy;tion ex&shy;clus&shy;ively for the Rus&shy;si&shy;an print&shy;ing.
